	<h2>UE CALOOCAN</h2>
        <img src="UE Seal.png" alt="UE Seal">
	<h3>Bachelor of Fine Arts Major in Painting</h3>
        <p>Before entering NU Asia Pacific College, I first studied at UE Caloocan for the school year 2021-2022. It is here where I was admitted and enrolled as a Fine Arts student which I Majored in Painting, hence, giving me my first experiene of studying as a college student at a university. I'd however see a turning point given its distance from home, everyday expenses and future career reasons that could affect my convenient plan towards success.</p>

	<h2>NEW ERA UNIV.</h2>
        <img src="NEU Seal.png" alt="NEU Seal">
	<h3>Elementary & Highschool</h3>
        <p>As an Iglesia Ni Cristo myself, NEU became the most considerable school for me. My journey here started at the year 2013 as a fifth grade student and happily graduated at the year 2015 finishing gradeschool and turning to highschool. Remembering and including this special school not only brings the entitlement and sentiments. But also, the teachings including computer stuff and frankly HTML makes it a lot "worth-the-moment" information type.</p>

	<h2>NU APC</h2>
        <img src="NU Seal.png" alt="NU Seal">
	<h3>Bachelor of Science in Information and Technology with Specialization in Mobile and Internet Technology </h3>
        <p>Right after deeply and critically analyzing my career path, it is with the end of the UE Caloocan journey from Fine Arts that I've decided to revert from one of the interested course of knowledge that I personally first acknowledged which is being an IT. Gladly, it is in fact one of my forte or skill to learn technology.

	<h2>CYCLING</h2>
        <img src="cycling.png" alt="Cycling">
	<h3>An endless and expensive hobby</h3>
        <p>From the era of the COVID-19 pandemic peek up to its slow vanishment. Cycling has become one of the interesting sport and hobby that I've developed aiding my capability to help my body's endurance and also, allowing myself to go places and explore different cycling experiences along also with different cyclists. Cycling is really fun and yet, very expensive. I like cycling back then because for me, it's not just a sport but rather a life-long worthy mode of struggle and exercise.</p>

	<h2>PAINTING</h2>
        <img src="painting.jpg" alt="painting">
	<h3>A legacy always present and manifested at work</h3>
        <p>It is with my father's gift of being creative and artistic where the creative bloodline was drawn from, hence, providing the inheritance of painting skills and creative ideas. As a life-long legacy of my father, I was gladly and proficiently allowed to work beside my father's paintings giving me the opportunity to learn, develop and also earn for myself with the presence of the continuing bloodline talent that we have on painting.

	<h2>WEIGHTLIFTING</h2>
        <img src="weighlifting.png" alt="Weighlifting">
	<h3>Who else is going to carry the weights</h3>
        <p>As a gym-goer even at an age of 17, it has become a great philosophy and struggle for myself to find the confidence and masculinity that I seek for others to see and know that I can dominate and take part of the heavy burdens running on this world. I started firstly addressing my physical strength hence paying me of later on with the worthy reward of gaining an image of confidence and sturdiness. Lifting weights and carving my body has been one of the interesting hobby that not only serves as my leisure, but also, sport and betterment.</p>

	<h2>THE WEEKND</h2>
        <img src="the weeknd.png" alt="The Weeknd">
	<h3>Mysterious person fuel jam</h3>
        <p>For me, The Weeknd's song has been one of my favorites given its consistent vibe of real pop and sometimes modern synthwave beats providing me the vibe of music mixing the emotional lyrics, funky beats and cathcy lyrics also. In addition, it is with him that I personally had observed that I am also an emotional person who can easily be attached to cathcy R&B synthwave types of music.</p>

    <div class="image-description">
	<h2>HONNE</h2>
        <img src="honne.jpg" alt="Honne">
	<h3>Music for love and personal experience</h3>
        <p>Their music often explores themes of love, relationships, and personal experiences, conveyed through smooth vocals, intricate production, and emotive lyrics. Their performances exude an intimate aura, inviting you to immerse yourself in their world of sound and emotion. Hence, making HONNE as one of my go-to in times of need of some tunes to immerse myself during emotional moments also.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image-description">
	<h2>POST MALONE</h2>
        <img src="post malone.jpg" alt="Post Malone">
	<h3>Rapper and singer born out of introspection and celebration</h3>
        <p>After hearing first his first hits of "Congratulations", "White Iverson" and "Go Flex", I found myself liking his pieces because of the catchy raps and rhythms and also, during at his peek, his trend also among my woke friends towards swag and fame. However, 'til now, I find Post Malone as one of my go-to artists for his great contribution to music creation and influence.</p>

	<h2>CHICKEN</h2>
        <img src="chicken.png" alt="Chicken">
	<h3>My go-to-protein</h3>
        <p>Ever since being concious about how meats are supposed to be levelled upon the process of diet and body building. My usual protein is steamed chicken and I really love it since it is the most simplest and accessible meat to prepare when it comes to eating. Also, I personally find a steamed breast part of the chicken a lot easier to make me feel full and nourished after from my hardwork exercises at the gym. I usually crave for it for my post-workout meals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image-description">
	<h2>CUCUMBER</h2>
        <img src="cucumber.png" alt="Cucumber">
	<h3>My rice sometimes</h3>
        <p>Basing on how I see professional coaches at gyms eat cucumbers, I think that it is really reasonable to eat cucumber especially also for the likes of me who is now on the cutting phase from bodybuilding because obviously it is a vegetable. Also, it is scientifically stated that it is really common for bodybuilders to include cucumbers since it aids muscle flexibility, skin health, aches and pains, and also promote stronger bones and muscles. </p>

    <div class="image-description">
	<h2>BOILED EGGS</h2>
        <img src="egg.png" alt="Egg">
	<h3>Protein and simplest form of energy reincarnated</h3>
        <p>Just like how the two favorite foods that I've mentioned, eggs similarly are also easy to prepare and for instance healthy. It is the most common knowdledge for anyone that eggs are one of the greatest source of protein and energy, hence making it also my favorite and most important food to include on my diet. It may vary from sunny-side up, scrambled and hard-boiled, as long as it is egg, I'll eat it. Well, except balut.</p>
